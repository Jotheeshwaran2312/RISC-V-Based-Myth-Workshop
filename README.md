## RV Day 1 - Introduction to RISC-V ISA and GNU compiler toolchain

### RV-D1SK1 - Introduction to RISC-V basic keywords

#### RV_D1SK1_L1_Introduction
The workshop outlines the complete open-source chip design flow, illustrating the connection between high-level application software and structural silicon layout.

* **RISC-V Architecture:** Translates software programs (like a C code script) via a GNU toolchain compiler into localized hardware execution parameters using standard RISC-V assembly language instruction sets.
* **Hardware Implementation:** Utilizes a parameterized HDL description framework (such as the `picorv32` CPU core structure) to define the register logic gates.
* **Physical Layout:** Converts the verified RTL layout into discrete physical logic components (like standard cell blocks) via an open-source synthesis implementation runner (`qflow`).
